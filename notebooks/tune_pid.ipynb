This is where you come in! Select the PID gains that stabilize the system.\n","\n","Some helpful tips for tuning:\n","- Start with P-gain (keeping the others zero). Increase the P-gain until you see the system respond with enough force to counteract gravity and bring the pendulum back to the top. With only proportional gain, the system will overshoot wildly, not settling. A physical analogy for P-gain is a \"spring\" (remember Hooke's' law: $F = -k x$? That's like P-gain!) The more P, the bouncier the system will behave.\n","- Next, increase D-gain. An analogy for D-gain is \"damping\". (Friction is often modeled as $F = -k v$.) D-gain helps the system slow down as the pendulum approaches the setpoint to avoid overshooting. Increase D-gain until you see this effect.\n","- Finally, increase I-gain. I-gain helps eliminate residual error by nudging the system to the correct position even if the error is not large enough for P-gain to take sufficient action. Since I-gain requires integration over time, it will not act as quickly as P-gain. Strike a balance between P and I. I-gain is particularly useful when compensating for disturbances or modeling errors. Since our system is idealized, you will find that I-gain is not needed for good performance in simulation, but may be needed on the physical pendulum.\n","\n","Keep iterating this process, tweaking your gains as you see how the system responds.\n","\n","When you run this cell, note that we pass our `cart_pole_pid` and initial conditions to `solve_ivp`.

If you tuned it properly, the PID controller actually does a better job stabilizing $\\theta$: driving $\\theta$ to zero faster and with less overshoot! Why is this the case? (Answer: While PID only has one objective, LQR needs to compromise in order to minimize cost and drive all state variables to zero.)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"KzAWMclGoX5V"},"outputs":[],"source":["plot_cart_pole(PLOT_LQR = True)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"4tIMULp9oX5Y"},"outputs":[],"source":["# --- LQR ANIMATION ---\n","# Run animation\n","screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width_px, screen_height_px))\n","np_frames = animate_system(sol_lqr, len(t_eval), dt, animation_dt)\n","\n","# Save animation\n","numpngw.write_apng(animation_path, np_frames, delay=animation_dt)\n","display(Image(filename=animation_path))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gL2qxGPnEnOX"},"source":["### Cost Comparison\n","\n","Finally, let's compare the \"cost\" between LQR and PID.
